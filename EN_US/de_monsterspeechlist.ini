172	Someone said, the Goblin is better looking than me. That's nonsense.
173	We are better than the Goblins!
174	Ouch! That hurt!
175	I'll teach you a lesson!
176	You're dead!
177	Ugh, I should have retreated.
178	Ugh, I should have retreated.
179	Hey! There's an invader!
180	Don't poke fun at my size!
181	Yeah, I'm coming for you now!
182	Today's work is endless…
183	I always get so much work, jeez!!
184	I'll teach you a lesson!
185	I'll show you my power.
186	You're the one that attacked me awhile ago. You're dead!!
187	Ugh, I should have retreated.
188	Ugh...boss, please avenge me.
189	Hey! There's an invader!
190	I grew up fighting in the streets.
191	I'm am the greatest fighter there ever will be!
192	This is boring.
193	This is boring.
194	You seem like a challenge. Let's fight!
195	You are quite powerful.
196	Run run run run run run run run
197	Oh this can't be happening.
198	Ugh...boss, please avenge me.
199	I need backup!
200	Hey! Stop goofing around!
201	Hypits are not disciplined these days. All they want to do is goof around.
202	Who is on the lunch duty today? This is totally Goblin garbage!
203	Check it out, that old man is looking for Goblins again.
204	I can take you out myself!
205	For the Hypits!
206	If you value your life, surrender!
207	There's a lot of things I didn't get to do.
208	Please take care of these Goblins.
209	Did you think I wouldn't have backup? Ha!
210	Check out my magic skills.
211	When will today's shift end?
212	How did I get demoted to doing this?
213	We, Hypits too can posses the power of magic.
214	Hm…. This is an interesting find.
215	This is an opportunity to put my skills to the test.
216	I can't focus!
217	Why do I have to die like this?
218	Ugh...boss, please avenge me.
219	Feel the power of magic!
220	I may be small in size, but I'm in charge of the Hypits.
221	Where did the everyone go? They always dissappear when I need a favor.
222	Have you heard of the gang of the Gold Mine Hill?
223	There's no boss that's great as me.
224	How dare you trespass our land?
225	You're messing with the wrong person! I'm the superior Hypit.
226	I won't make you suffer too much when I kill you.
227	Let everyone know I died in honor…
228	Who is going to avenge me?
229	Hypits, it's time to show them our power. Punish the intruders!
230	We always fight in large numbers.
231	We are not like the Hypits.
232	I'm worried about the condition of this mine.
233	Hm. Is this the right place?
234	Don't underestimate me because I'm small!
235	How dare you step into our territory? You better get ready for this!
236	Long live the Goblins!
237	I don't want to die.
238	My life ends like this?
239	Attack!!!
240	Ow. My back!
241	What happened to respecting your elders?
242	Hey little goblin where did you?
243	Hey did you see my little little goblin friend?
244	How dare you strike an old man?
245	Respect your elders!
246	Show some manners.
247	I guess this is my fate.
248	Goblins take care..
249	What are you guys doing? Help this old man!
250	We are the unstoppable Goblins!
251	Long live the Goblins!
252	You dare to attack me?
253	Why do I get so much work?
254	How can you sleep with your level?
255	Ahh! You're attacking me again!
256	Are you sure you want to mess with me?
257	Stop attacking me!
258	Grandpa help me!
259	Help me guys!
260	Wow, this helmet is so heavy!
261	For the Goblins!
262	Go Goblins!
263	Goblins! Attention!
264	You do not know who you're messing with.
265	You're not gonna get away with that!
266	I guess you haven't heard about my legend of my steel ax.
267	It's too early for me to go.
268	You don't want to mess with me and my ax.
269	Goblins attack!
270	Check out my awesome hat.
271	No one has ever survived our attack.
272	Don't I look tough?
273	Not only you have to be tough, you have to look tough too.
274	Hah! Today is your unlucky day!
275	I am as tought as I look!
276	Prepare to be eliminated!
277	Guess I don't have to worry about looking so tough.
278	Ugh. I'm dying.
279	Help! I need backup!
280	The Goblins have been slacking these days.
281	How dare anyone mess with my guys? I won't get them get away with it!
282	I told you guys to take care of the holy sword. Ah you guys are useless!
283	Don't judge me by my size because I will hurt you.
284	You hurt my guys? You better be ready for this!
285	Ha! Too much for you?
286	You people always underestimate us.
287	I'm not a loser.
288	Take care of those Hypits at least.
289	Where did everyone go?
290	Don't mistake us for goats. We are the Faunus!
291	Check out these horns!
292	Check out my solid body!
293	My powerful legs can take anyone out.
294	It is fate that brought you here. Now I can demostrate my skills.
295	You are no match for me!
296	This will be the worst day of your life.
297	Ugh..My Faunus brothers, take care.
298	Stop it!
299	These people are trashing our holy land. Get rid of the invaders!!!
300	We Faunus are the rulers of this forest!
301	Who stole my weapon?
302	We Faunus are unstoppable!
303	I'm not only strong, but I fight smart.
304	I'm coming!
305	I'll show you my true strength.
306	Did you just hit me? That was a big mistake!

316	You will get clubbed so many times.
317	You beat me.
318	I'm am no match for you.
319	My fellow Faunus, it is time to fight!
320	My sword can cut through anything.
321	I'm a professional warrior.
322	You're an amateur!
323	The horns on my head is a symbol of power.
324	Check out my sword skills.
325	I'll show you what I'm made of!
326	You will get killed from just a graze from my sword.
327	That's great...
328	You're too strong for me.
329	I wanted to face you myself, but oh well. Attack the invaders!
330	My shots are very accurate. I'm a marksman.
331	I only can hit the bull's eye of the mark
332	Should I check if there are any enemies?
333	Am I too charming?
334	I'll show you my fantastic shooting skills
335	I'll show you my secret power. Target hitting!!!!

801	It's been a long time since I came out to the world. It feels good.
802	Aroo~~ Listen to my cry!!

809	What? Habris sent you? Damn, I should have gotten over with it before, I'm angry.
810	Hahahaha!!! The blood is boiling!!! I'll destruct everything!!
811	Your death will be my meal
812	It's been a long time since an unwelcomed guest came last… I should get paid. By your death, of course
813	You should die by yourself if you want to die… Why do you keep bothering me?
814	I will destroy your body as well as your soul!! By my power!!
815	Hey my children!! Destroy the ones that resist me
816	You pushed me into the corner like this, you're pretty good… But this is only beginning!!
817	I'll make you into a frozen body!!!
818	It is useless trying to live!! You are already dying
819	You little things are trying to rebell. I'll show you the real nightmare!!
820	That is all you got?  I am starting to get bored!
821	You need years of training to fight me.  You are a waste of my time.
822	So long, you useless creature!
823	Raawwwwrrrrrr!
824	You're useless! This will be the end of you!
825	My children, take these arrogant fools to the pit of pain.
826	KKKK! So you have come this deep to rescue Prometheus?!
827	But you are late, his souls have become vile, only thing left for him is the destruction and greed.
828	You release him and you will suffer the destruction of your world! Leave now!!
829	Krrrk..You truly wish to see him..? KKK..You humans are just foolish..
830	Pathetic human..you are just heading for your own grave..
831	You want to save him? You will have to take me down first!!
832	Hahaha. Heroes of Human! You've been looking for me?
833	Here's a little gift for your effort.
834	Fire of Perish, and death!!!
835	Come! You pathetic beings!
836	Who might you be?You're brave, coming all the way down here, or should I say.. Foolish.
837	For what purpose have you come to this end?To free me?Or to exterminate Titan whom even Olympus Gods feared once and for all?
838	Huhuhu..whatever you've come for. It's too late now. My soul has already melted down in this pit of darkness. See it by yourselves!
839	You've done a great job, warriors. The world has approached to an end thanks to you.
840	This old chain, and worthless oath won't stop me!
841	Fires, emerge!Kill all that's living!From here, to Olympus above the heaven!
842	You humans never change. Foolish, and weak.
843	Come. Titan's creations!Obey me!Kill them!
844	You dare to resist me?
845	Is this the end..?My life..is fading..along with the curse of Baphomet..now I can see everything.
846	..Are you the descendant of human?Are you..the descendant of whom I was supposed to protect?You truly have the braveness and strength to fight the giant..
847	My suffer has ended finally..You have done what Olympus gods couldn't..You have done well..
